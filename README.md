   `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`:

    ```objective-c
    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
    {
        [PSLocation setApiKey:@"YOUR_API_KEY" andClientID:@"YOUR_CLIENT_ID"];
        return YES;
    }
    ```

2. Import the PSLocation framework header in **AppDelegate.h**:

    ```objective-c
    #import <PSLocation/PSLocation.h>
    ```

# Using Swift

1. In your **AppDelegate**, add the following to  
   `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`:

    ```swift
    func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                     didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        PSLocation.setApiKey("YOUR_API_KEY", andClientID: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID")
